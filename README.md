## Technologies

I have designed this webpage using HTML and CSS, the UX inspiration came from a minimalistic perspective.
The navigation bar was implemented using CSS flex to facilitate the responsivness of the element.
A similar process was applied to the body and footer.
The main targets of this product are home owners and companies looking to renovate their home or/and Work enviroments.

Font Family: "Barlow Condensed".

The color combination I have decided to use brings high contrast to the eye.

## User Comments

As a user that navigates I would like to find websites that are friendly to the eye, and are easier to navigate and that takes me straight to the point.

## Features

1. Implementing basic ux.
2. Gathering content.
3. Creating a mobile responsive platform.

### Features Left to Implement

In a near future I would like to implement:

1. Use bootstrap for a more smooth transition between breakpoints;
2. Add Jquery for real life contact form submission.

## Technologies Used

For this project I have mainly used HTML & CSS. According to the project objective.
I was inclined to add a small portion of JS in the videoo gallery for playing and stop purposes and for the navigation menu.

## Contact form

1. Users cannot submit an empty form.
2. Users cannot submit a wrong format on email address field.
3. Success message appears in the end.
4. I have developed a responsive page, using Flex, to make it more responsive.

## Testing

There was an Error that appeared on line 33 of the navgation elements, for my close button for the nav elements where I've accidentally nested a div inside a ul. the error is now fixed;

No other erros were found in this project.

## Deployment

During the process I have encountered some challenges in the media queries phase. Where with so many devices to cover.

Current version is 3.2

## Compatibility

The product was tested on Firefox, Edge and Chrome. No problems were detected.

Keeping it quite minimalistic and adopting the less is more philosophy.
