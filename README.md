This website was created for the Code Institute as the main part of my project (MLS 1).
The main goal with this page is to be able to attract job opprtunities within the Software developing world, as well as potential customers in the freelancing enviroment.

## UX

I have designed this webpage using HTML and CSS, the UX was kept minimal and clean. Making the user experience more effective, which in a real world scenario is crucial to attract attention of potential buyers for a company product or service.

## Technologies

The main targets of this product are home owners and companies looking to renovate their home or/and Work enviroments.

## User Comments

As a user that navigates I would like to find websites that are friendly to the eye, and are easier to navigate and that takes me straight to the point.

## Features

1. Implementing basic ux.
2. Gathering content.
3. Creating a mobile responsive platform.
4. Creating a desktop responsive platform.
5. Colours and contrast.

### Existing Features

Feature 1 - Allows users to navigate throught the page with ease.
Feature 2 - Allows users to hover over clickable elements.
Feature 3 - Allows users to play video video on various modes, including picture-in-picture.
Feature 4 - The contact page has an inquiry form allowing users to explain a little about their needs while storing their data.

For this project I have mainly used HTML & CSS. According to the project objective.
I was inclined to add a small portion of JS in the videoo gallery for playing and stop purposes and for the navigation menu.

### Features Left to Implement

In a near future I would like to implement:

1. Add Jquery for real life contact form submission.

## Technologies Used

[Google fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
Font Family: "Barlow Condensed" for the entire project.

[Font Awesome:](https://ionicons.com/)
The icon combination used on the nav bar and on the content pages were downloaded from Ion Icons.

The color combination I have decided to use brings high contrast to the eye.

## Contact form

1. Users cannot submit an empty form.
2. Users cannot submit a wrong format on email address field.
3. Success message appears in the end.
4. I have developed a responsive page, using Flex, to make it more responsive.

## Testing

There was an Error that appeared on line 33 of the navgation elements, for my close button for the nav elements where I've accidentally nested a div inside a ul. the error is now fixed;

No other erros were found in this project.

## Deployment

During the process I have encountered some challenges in the media queries phase. Where with so many devices to cover.

Current version is 3.5

## Compatibility

The product was tested on Firefox, Edge and Chrome. No problems were detected.
