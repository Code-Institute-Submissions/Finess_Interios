[View the live project here.](https://fdasabino.github.io/Finess_Interios/index.html)

This website was designed for the Code Institute as the main part of my project (MLS 1).
The main goal with this page is to be able to attract job opprtunities within the Software developing world, as well as potential customers in the freelancing enviroment.

## User Experience (UX)

I have designed this webpage using HTML and CSS, the UX was kept minimal and clean. Making the user experience more effective, which in a real world scenario is crucial to attract attention of potential buyers for a company product or service.

I've included the feature of social media links on the footer section so one can navigate directly to the social media pages of the company and a clickable position pin that opens an address on google maps. (fake address of course.)

The website also includes the possibility to navigate between pages, photo and video gallery and contact form sendable to the form dump page of CI.

## Technologies Used

### Languages

[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

[CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs

[Bootstrap:](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Boostrap was used to help implementing a more resposive layout and some of the styling features (that being said the JS files in the project were brought in as bootstrap libraries APOLOGIES).

[Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/) - Google fonts were used to import the 'Barlow Condensed' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

[GitHub:](https://github.com/) - GitHub is used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

[VScode:](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Visual Studio Code was used in combination with Git to execute the code editing.

## User Comments

As a user that navigates I would like to find websites that are friendly to the eye, and are easier to navigate and that takes me straight to the point.

## Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page. Due to the use of boostrap some errors were shown. The ids implemneted by their framework were in some cases repeated which cause the validator to identify it as an error. With that said no other errors were found. That does not create any problem with the document reponsivness or styles.

There was an Error that appeared on line 33 of the navgation elements, for my close button for the nav elements where I've accidentally nested a div inside a ul. the error is now fixed;

No other erros were found in this project.

## Features

1. Basic and clean UX.
2. Several sections within pages which facilitates finding content.
3. Mobile responsive platform.
4. Fully functional video and photo gallery.
5. Contact form.

### Features Left to Implement

In a near future I would like to implement:

1. Add Jquery for real life contact form submission.
2. Make more use of programming languages to make the wesite more interactive.

## Technologies Used

[Google fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/)
Font Family: "Barlow Condensed" for the entire project.

[Font Awesome:](https://fontawesome.com/)
The icon combination used on the nav bar and on the content pages were downloaded from Ion Icons.

[Getwaves:](https://getwaves.io/)
The wave effects on my pages were downloaded from getwaves.com.

[CSS Gradient:](https://cssgradient.io/)
The color combination I have decided to use brings high contrast to the eye.
