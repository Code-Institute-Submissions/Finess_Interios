# Finess_Interiors

This website was created for the Code Institute as the main part of my project (MLS 1).

Interior designed dedicated to making your home or working space unique.

## UX

![mobile 320px](https://github.com/fdasabino/Finess_Interios/blob/39a46fbfb66d44fae49c7333db10eee47d275835/assets/images/frames/320-home.jpg)

I have designed this webpage using HTML and CSS, the UX inspiration came from a minimalistic perspective.
The navigation bar was implemented using CSS flex to facilitate the responsivness of the element.
A similar process was applied to the body and footer.
The main targets of this product are home owners and companies looking to renovate their home or/and Work enviroments.

As a user that navigates I would like to find websites that are friendly to the eye, and are easier to navigate and that takes me straight to the point.

Font Style: "Barlow Condensed".

The color combination I have decided to use brings high contrast to the eye.

## Features

1. Implementing basic ux.
2. Gathering content.
3. Creating a mobile responsive platform (+400px).
4. Creating a desktop responsive platform.
5. Colours and contrast.

### Existing Features

Feature 1 - Allows users to navigate throught the page with ease.
Feature 2 - Allows users to hover over clickable elements which will either light up or turn gray.
Feature 3 - Allows users to play video video on various modes, including picture-in-picture.
Feature 4 - The contact page has an inquiry form allowing users to explain a little about their needs while storing their data.

### Features Left to Implement

### Another feature idea

Eventually I'd like to implement a picture trasition to the main page in order to give
it the impression of less static.

## Technologies Used

For this project I have mainly used HTML & CSS. According to the project objective.
I was inclined to add a small portion of JS in the videoo gallery for playing and stop purposes.

## Contact form

Users cannot submit an empty form.

Users cannot submit a wrong format on email address field.

Success message appears in the end.

I have developed a responsive page, using Flex, to make it more responsive.

## Deployment

I have done version control deployment, once the nav bar and footer were in place.

During the process I have encountered some challenges in the media queries phase. Where with so many devices to cover.

Current version is 2.1

The inspiration for the website came from a friend that works as an architect. Keeping it quite minimalistic
and adopting the less is more philosophy.
