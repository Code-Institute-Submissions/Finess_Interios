# Finess_Interiors

Interior designed dedicated to making your home or working space unique.

## UX

Font Style: "Barlow Condensed".

I have designed this webpage using HTML and CSS, the UX inspiration came from a minimalistic perspective.
The navigation bar was implemented using CSS flex to facilitate the responsivness of the element.
A similar process was applied to the footer.
The main targets of this product are home owners and companies looking to renovate their home or/and Work enviroments.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

<!-- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser. -->

### Features Left to Implement

### Another feature idea

Eventually I'd like to implement a picture trasition to the main page in order to give
it the impression of less static.

## Technologies Used

For this project I have mainly used HTML & CSS. According to the project objective.
I was inclined to add a small portion of JS in the videoo gallery for playing and stop purposes.

## Contact form:

Users cannot submit an empty form.

Users cannot submit a wrong format on email address field.

Sucess message appears in the end.

I have developed a responsive page, using Flex, to make it more responsive.

## Deployment

I have done version control deployment, once the nav bar and footer were in place.

During the process I have encountered some challenges in the media queries phase. Where with so many devices to cover.

Current version is 2.0
