                Best decision ever! There are no words to express what these
                wonderful and beautiful human beings did for us. They took our
                house and transformed it into our home. They read us, understood
                our needs and captured our style with unbelievable
                professionalism. They are able to go beyond their profound
                knowledge and connect with the client as a human being, so each
                detail in our home says something about us as a family. We keep
                rediscovering it as time passes by. There is no place we rather
                be than home, and part of that feeling we definitely have to
                thank finess for.

                The team was very easy to work with. They took the effort to
                find out our preferred style and colour scheme and easily
                adjusted whenever we wavered. Everything was handled very
                professionally by the team. We are really enjoying our condo in
                Miami and have got lots of compliments. Now we are working on
                our home in Winnipeg, Canada and of course the team at Finess
                went above and beyond to make sure we were totally satisfied.
                Our client relationship has blossomed into a friendship.
