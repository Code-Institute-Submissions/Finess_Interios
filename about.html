              Best decision ever! There are no words to express what these
              wonderful and beautiful human beings did for us. They took our
              house and transformed it into our home. They read us, understood
              our needs and captured our style with unbelievable
              professionalism. They are able to go beyond their profound
              knowledge and connect with the client as a human being, so each
              detail in our home says something about us as a family. We keep
              rediscovering it as time passes by. There is no place we rather
              be than home, and part of that feeling we definitely have to
              thank finess for.

              The team was very easy to work with. They took the effort to
              find out our preferred style and colour scheme and easily
              adjusted whenever we wavered. Everything was handled very
              professionally by the team. We are really enjoying our condo in
              Miami and have got lots of compliments. Now we are working on
              our home in Winnipeg, Canada and of course the team at Finess
              went above and beyond to make sure we were totally satisfied.
              Our client relationship has blossomed into a friendship.
